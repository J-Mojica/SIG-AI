# SIG-AI

NJIT SIG-AI Repository for projects and activities.

## [Project 1](./Projects/TicTacToe): Adversarial Search Agent (Minimax) for TicTacToe
This is the first project of NJIT ACM's SIG-AI. An implementation of an adversarial search agent which uses the minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning, one of the various topics we looked at during the Spring 2022 semester.

This project was developed as a demonstration of how to implement an AI from some of the theory we discussed during club meetings and is intenended as an introduction for people who are new to AI. Most of it was done during club meetings in sessions of 1-2 hours, and later improved and cleaned up.
